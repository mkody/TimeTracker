# TimeTracker
> Note when something happens, for tracking.

Just open the app, write what's happening and press add (or <kbd>ENTER</kbd>).  
Global hotkey <kbd>SHIFT + CTRL + T</kbd> is set to bring the app quickly. App will also minimize to tray.

Data is saved in a simple .csv called `elements.csv` in the same directory of the .exe.  
The "backup" button in the menu will save the data as `elements.TIMESTAMP.csv`.  
It only has two columns: `Timestamp` (in seconds) and `Description`.
